# React Overview Blog

To practice, a demo project was built with:

- React + TypeScript for type safety.
- Recoil for client-side global state management (auth, user info).
- React Query for server state (CRUD posts, authentication API).
- Ant Design for UI components (forms, tables, modals, navigation).

This stack allows building a blog-style application with:

- Authentication (Sign in, Sign up,role). 
- Posts CRUD with React Query.
- Responsive UI using Ant Design.
